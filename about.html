              <h2>Work</h2>
              <p>
                The main purpose of the International Space Station is to
                provide an international laboratory for experiments within the
                space environment.
              </p>
              <p>
                The ISS serves as a microgravity and space environment research
                laboratory in which crew members conduct experiments in biology,
                human biology, physics, astronomy, meteorology, and other fields
              </p>
              <p>
                The crew also has to make sure that the station is in top shape,
                so they clean, check equipment, maintain and repair or replace
                broken equipment.
              </p>

              <h2>Spacewalks</h2>
              <p>
                Trips outside the station are called "spacewalks," and they take
                a lot of preparation and safety training.
              </p>
              <p>
                astronauts do spacewalk to work outside the station in their
                space suits.
              </p>
              <p>It’s a tough and dangerous job but the view is terrific.</p>
              <p>
                One wrong move and an astronaut could just float off into the
                vacuum of space. They also have to watch for leaks in the
                spacesuits that protect them from the bitterly cold temperatures
                and radiation in space.

              <h2>Training</h2>
              <p>
                Crew members must exercise two hours each day to stay fit and
                keep their bones and muscles strong.
              </p>
              <p>
                They have mandatory workouts so they don't lose too much muscle
                mass in the weightless environment. (Since they don't have to
                fight gravity, they get a lot less exercise while moving
                around.)
              </p>
              <p>
                You can easily lift hundreds of pounds in a weightless
                environment, so astronauts have a cleverly designed machine for
                weight lifting.

              <h2>Food</h2>
              <p>
                Since we don’t have a freezer, refrigerator, stove or microwave,
                most of the food has already been cooked, then freeze dried and
                vacuum packed, or it is thermally stabilized (meaning treated
                and sealed in a package to prevent spoiling), much like camping
                food.
              </p>
              <p>
                Packages of freeze dried food can be reconstituted by adding
                water and then warmed up in a small warming oven.
              </p>

              <p>
                If objects escape inside the ISS, they can float away, get
                lodged in equipment, and cause malfunctions.

              <h2>Sleep</h2>
              <p>
                The middle section of the station is where most of the crew
                sleeps.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each astronaut has their own tiny room that includes a work
                space and a sleeping bag strapped to the wall.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sleeping in space is hard to get used to since you don't feel
                the sensation of lying down. Astronauts zip themselves into a
                sleeping bag every night so they don't float around in their
                sleep.
              </p>
              <p>
                And they have to keep careful track of their sleep schedule
                since days don't pass the same on the ISS as they do on Earth.
                The station is whizzing around the planet so quickly that the
                crew sees about 16 sunrises and sunsets during a 24-hour Earth
                day.

                The space potty is a little different than the Earth potty.
                First of all, to keep from floating away, you must use
                foot-loops or straps while ‘sitting’ on the seat. This holds you
                on to the seat, sort of like a seat belt. Secondly, the space
                potty uses suction, not water, to ‘flush.’
              </p>
              <p>
                Small tasks like clipping your nails become a problem.
                Astronauts clip them near a vent, so that tiny pieces of nail
                don't end up floating all over the station.
              </p>
              <p>
                To was or shower astronauts squirt a few lines of water on their
                skin and hair and then use no-rinse soap and shampoo to clean
                themselves.
